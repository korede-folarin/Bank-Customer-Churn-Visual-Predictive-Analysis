# Bank-Customer-Churn-Visual-Predictive-Analysis
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores why retail banking customers churn and how to predict it using machine learning. The notebook includes:

Exploratory data analysis with visualizations

Key churn insights by geography, age, balance, and activity

A baseline predictive model (Logistic Regression with SMOTE)

Summaries of findings and recommendations

All results, visual explanations, and conclusions are contained within the notebook itself.

# Project Overview

 Dataset: 10,021 retail bank customers

 Goal: Identify churn drivers and build a predictive model

 #### Key Findings:

Overall churn rate ≈ 20.4%

Germany has the highest churn, especially for high-balance customers

France & Spain show more churn for medium-balance customers

Ages 41–60 are most churn-prone; inactivity increases churn risk

Model Performance:

Logistic Regression with SMOTE

ROC-AUC ≈ 0.787

Recall ≈ 0.715, Precision ≈ 0.395


# What’s Inside

Jupyter Notebook — full analysis, from visualizations to model building

README.md — project documentation (you’re reading it!)


# Results

Customers’ location, account balance, and activity level strongly influence churn.

A baseline model achieves good recall, meaning it correctly identifies many churn cases.

Business recommendation: focus on German high-balance customers and inactive middle-aged customers to reduce churn.
