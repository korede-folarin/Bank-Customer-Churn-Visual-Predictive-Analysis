# Bank-Customer-Churn-Visual-Predictive-Analysis
A compact, well-documented data visualization and ML project exploring why bank customers churn and how to predict it using a classical ML pipeline. This repo contains the original Jupyter notebook.

# Project Overview

## Dataset: 10,021 retail bank customers

## Goal: Identify churn drivers and build a predictive model

## Key Findings:

## Overall churn rate ≈ 20.4%

##  Germany has the highest churn, especially for high-balance customers

####  France & Spain show more churn for medium-balance customers

## Ages 41–60 are most churn-prone; inactivity increases churn risk

## Model Performance:

## Logistic Regression with SMOTE

## ROC-AUC ≈ 0.787

## Recall ≈ 0.715, Precision ≈ 0.395
